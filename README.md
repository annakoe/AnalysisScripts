# AnalysisScripts
This repository documents the bioinformatic analyses used to produce the results in my PhD thesis.

The file Master_Analysis.pdf contains a step-by-step documentation. The custom scripts referred to in Master_Analysis.pdf are stored in the folders "scripts_python", "scripts_R", and "scripts_perl_and_C" respectively.
The samplefiles referred to in Master_Analysis.pdf Chapter 4 are stored in the folder "samplefiles"

Master_Analysis.pdf:
Chapter 1 describes the design of so-called degenerate gRNA libraries. The aim is to find a consensus oligonucleotide sequence that enriches for binding to sites of interest, here promoters.
Chapter 2 describes the analysis I conducted of sequencing data derived from the degenerate and MNase digest libraries.
Chapter 3 describes the in silico design of the EMT5000 library, which contains gRNAs targeting the regulatory regions around 15 genes known to be involved in the regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
Chapter 4 describes the data analysis of screening experiments using monoclonal stable cell lines expressing either the dCas9-p300 or dCas9-SET7 chromatin modifier and the EMT5000 gRNA library.
