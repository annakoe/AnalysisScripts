# AnalysisScripts
This repository documents the bioinformatic analyses used to produce the results in my PhD thesis.

The Latex file Master_Analysis.pdf contains a step-by-step documentation. The custom scripts referred to in Master_Analysis document are stored in the folders "scripts_python" and "scripts_R", respectively.

Master_Analysis.pdf:
Chapter 1 describes the design of so-called degenerate gRNA libraries. The aim is to find a consensus oligonucleotide sequence that enriches for binding to sites of interest, here promoters.
Chapter 2 described the in silico design of the EMT5000 library, which contains gRNAs targeting the regulatory regions around 15 genes known to be involved in the regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
Chapter 3 describes the data analysis
